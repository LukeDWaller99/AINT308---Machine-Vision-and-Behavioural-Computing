abstract = {Time-spectral methods may feature substantial advantages over time-stepping solvers for solution of initial-value ODEs and PDEs, but their efficiency depends on the smoothness of the solution. We present two methods to overcome this problem. The first involves transforming the differential equation to an equation for a new variable, related to the time-integrated solution, before applying the solution algorithm. In the second method, a procedure for transformation to exact differential equations of a running average is outlined. Examples of solution of stiff problems and problems with multiple time scales are presented, employing the time-spectral Generalized Weighted Residual Method (GWRM). It is found that the smoothing algorithms have a significant positive effect on convergence.}
